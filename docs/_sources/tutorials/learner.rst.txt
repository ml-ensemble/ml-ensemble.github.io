Learner Mechanics
=================

ML-Ensemble is designed to provide an easy user interface. But it is also designed
to be extremely flexible, all the wile providing maximum concurrency at minimal
memory consumption. The lower-level API that builds the ensemble and manages the
computations is constructed in as modular a fashion as possible.

The low-level API introduces a computational graph-like environment that you can
directly exploit to gain further control over your ensemble. In fact, building
your ensemble through the low-level API is almost as straight forward as using the
high-level API. In this tutorial, we will walk through the key core :class:`Learner` class.


The Learner API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basics
------

When you pass an estimator to an ensemble, it gets wrapper
in a :class:`Learner` instance. This class records relevant information
about the estimator and manages the cross-validated fit. It also keeps
track of which preprocessing pipeline to use (if any). A learner is a parent node
in a computational sub-graph induced by the cross-validation strategy.



.. code-block:: python

    from mlens.utils.dummy import OLS
    from mlens.parallel import Learner
    from mlens.index import FoldIndex


    indexer = FoldIndex(folds=2)               # Define a training strategy
    learner = Learner(estimator=OLS(),         # Declare estimator
                      preprocess=None,         # We'll get to this
                      indexer=indexer,         # Our above instance
                      name='ols',              # Don't reuse name
                      attr='predict',          # Attribute for prediction
                      scorer=None,             # To get cv scores
                      output_columns={0: 0},   # Prediction feature index
                      verbose=True)







.. currentmodule:: mlens.index

The ``name`` gives the learner a cache reference. When the learner is
constructed by the high-level API , the name is guaranteed to be unique, but here
you must ensure all learner names are unique. The ``output_columns``
tells the learner which column index in an output array it should populate
when predicting. This helps us rapidly creating prediction with several learners. When
we have a unique prediction array use ``{0: 0}``. When the training strategy creates
partitions, we need to map ``output_columns`` for each partition. We'll see an example of this below.
The ``attr`` argument tells the learner which method to use.

.. currentmodule:: mlens.parallel.learner

The learner doesn't do any heavy lifting itself, it manages the creation a sub-graph
of auxiliary :class:`SubLearner` nodes for each fold during estimation.
This process is dynamic: the sub-learners are temporary instance created for each
estimation. To fit a learner, we first fit the indexer, then iterate through each of the
sub-learners created for the task:



.. code-block:: python


    import os, tempfile
    import numpy as np

    X = np.arange(20).reshape(10, 2)
    y = np.random.rand(10)

    # Fit the indexer to data to create fold indexes
    indexer.fit(X)

    # Specify a cache directory
    path = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(dir=os.getcwd())

    # Declare which type of job (fit, predict, transform) to run on which data
    for sub_learner in learner.gen_fit(X, y):
        sub_learner(path.name)

    print("Cached items:\n%r" % os.listdir(path.name))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    ols__0__0                      done | 00:00:00
    ols__0__1                      done | 00:00:00
    ols__0__2                      done | 00:00:00
    Cached items:
    ['ols__0__0.pkl', 'ols__0__1.pkl', 'ols__0__2.pkl']


Fitting the learner puts three copies of the OLS estimator in the ``path``
directory: one for each fold and one for the full dataset.
These are named as ``[name]__[col_id]__[fold_id]``. To load these into the
learner, call ``collect``.



.. code-block:: python


    learner.collect(path.name)







The main estimator, fitted on all data, gets stored into the
``learner_`` attribute, while the others are stored in the
``sublearners_``. These attributes are *generators* that create
sub-learners on-the-fly from cached fitted estimators when called upon.


To generate predictions, we can either use the ``sublearners_``
generator create cross-validated predictions, or ``learner_``
generator to generate predictions for the whole input set.


Similarly to above, we predict by specifying the job and the data to use.
Note that now we also specify the output array to populate.
In particular, the learner will populate the columns given in the
``output_columns`` parameter. Here, we use the ``transform`` task, which
uses the ``sublearners_`` generator to produce cross-validated
predictions.



.. code-block:: python


    P = np.zeros((y.shape[0], 1))
    for sub_learner in learner.gen_transform(X, P):
        sub_learner(path.name)
        print('P:')
        print(P)
        print()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    ols__0__1                      done | 00:00:00

     [ 0.46418811]]


In the above loop, a sub-segment of ``P`` is updated by each sublearner
spawned by the learner. To instead produce predictions for the full
dataset using the estimator fitted on all training data,
task the learner to ``predict``.



.. code-block:: python


    P = np.zeros((y.shape[0], 1))
    for sub_learner in learner.gen_predict(X, P):
        sub_learner(path.name)
        print('P:')
        print(P)
        print()

ML-Ensemble follows the Scikit-learn API, so if you wish to update any
hyper-parameters of the estimator, use the ``get_params`` and ``set_params``
API:



.. code-block:: python


    print("Params before:")
    print(learner.get_params())

    learner.set_params(estimator__offset=1, indexer__folds=3)

    print("Params after:")
    print(learner.get_params())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    Params before:
    {'attr': 'predict', 'auxiliary': None, 'estimator__offset': 0, 'estimator': OLS(offset=0), 'indexer__X': None, 'indexer__folds': 2, 'indexer__raise_on_exception': True, 'indexer': FoldIndex(X=None, folds=2, raise_on_exception=True), 'name': 'ols', 'output_columns': {0: 0}, 'preprocess': None, 'proba': False, 'scorer': None, 'backend': 'threading', 'n_jobs': -1, 'dtype': <class 'numpy.float32'>, 'raise_on_exception': True}
    Params after:
    {'attr': 'predict', 'auxiliary': None, 'estimator__offset': 1, 'estimator': OLS(offset=1), 'indexer__X': None, 'indexer__folds': 3, 'indexer__raise_on_exception': True, 'indexer': FoldIndex(X=None, folds=3, raise_on_exception=True), 'name': 'ols', 'output_columns': {0: 0}, 'preprocess': None, 'proba': False, 'scorer': None, 'backend': 'threading', 'n_jobs': -1, 'dtype': <class 'numpy.float32'>, 'raise_on_exception': True}


.. note:: Updating the indexer on one learner updates the indexer on all
 learners that where initiated with the same instance.


Partitioning
------------

We can create several other types of learners by
varying the estimation strategy. An especially interesting strategy is to
partition the training set and create several learners fitted on a given
partition. This will create one prediction feature per partition.
The learner handles the computational graph for us, all we need to
input is a mapping between partitions and output columns in the
``output_columns`` dict. In the following example we fit the OLS model
using two partitions and three fold CV on each
partition. Note that by passing the output array as an argument during ``'fit'``,
we get predictions immediately.



.. code-block:: python


    from mlens.index import SubsetIndex

    def mse(y, p): return np.mean((y - p) ** 2)

    indexer = SubsetIndex(partitions=2, folds=2, X=X)
    learner = Learner(estimator=OLS(),
                      preprocess=None,
                      indexer=indexer,
                      name='ols',
                      attr='predict',
                      scorer=mse,
                      output_columns={0: 0,    # First partition
                                      1: 1},   # Second partition
                      verbose=True)

    # P needs 2 cols
    P = np.zeros((y.shape[0], 2))

    # Pass P during 'fit' to get prediction immediately
    for sub_learner in learner.gen_fit(X, y, P):
        sub_learner.fit(path.name)
        print('P:')
        print(P)
        print()

    learner.collect(path.name)

Each sub-learner records fit and predict times during fitting, and if
a scorer is passed scores the predictions as well. The learner aggregates
this data into a ``raw_data`` attribute in the form of a list.
More conveniently, the ``data`` attribute returns a dict with a specialized
representation that gives a tabular output directly:
Standard data is fit time (``ft``), predict time (``pr``).
If a scorer was passed to the learner, cross-validated test set prediction
scores are computed. For brevity, ``-m`` denotes the mean and ``-s``
denotes standard deviation.



.. code-block:: python


    print("Data:\n%s" % learner.data)

Preprocessing
-------------

We can easily create a preprocessing pipeline before fitting the estimator.
In general, several estimators will share the same preprocessing pipeline,
so we don't want to pipeline the transformations in the estimator itself–
this will result in duplicate transformers.
The learner accepts a ``preprocess`` argument that points it to reference in
the estimation cache, and wil load the cached transformer for the given fold
when running an estimation. This does mean that the input will be processed
for each estimator and each fold, but pre-processing the data and storing the
data does not scale as memory consumption grows exponentially.
In contrast, running (not fitting) a transformer pipeline is often an
efficient operation that introduce only a minor overhead on computation time.


To facilitate preprocessing across several learners,
we need new type of node, the :class:`Transformer`. This class behaves
similarly to the learner, but differs in that it doesn't output any
predictions or transformations, but merely fits a pipeline and caches it
for the learner to load when needed. To construct a learner with
a preprocessing pipeline, we begin by constructing the
transformer.



.. code-block:: python


    from mlens.utils.dummy import Scale
    from mlens.parallel import Transformer

    transformer = Transformer(estimator=[('trans', Scale())],  # the pipeline should be a list of transformers
                              indexer=indexer,
                              name='sc',
                              verbose=True)







Now, to build the learner we now pass the ``name`` of the transformer as
the ``preprocess`` argument to the learner.



.. code-block:: python


    learner = Learner(estimator=OLS(),
                      preprocess='sc',
                      indexer=indexer,
                      name='ols',
                      attr='predict',
                      scorer=mse,
                      output_columns={0: 0, 1: 1},
                      verbose=True)







We now repeat the above process to fit the learner, starting with fitting
the transformer. Both follow the same API.



.. code-block:: python


    P = np.zeros((y.shape[0], 2))

    for st in transformer.gen_fit(X, y):
        st(path.name)

    for lr in learner.gen_fit(X, y, P):
        lr(path.name)

    transformer.collect(path.name)
    learner.collect(path.name)

Parallel estimation
-------------------

Since the learner and transformer class do not perform estimations themselves,
we are free to modify the estimation behavior. For instance, to parallelize
estimation with several learners, we don't want a nested loop over each learner,
but instead flatten the for loops for maximal concurrency.
This is the topic of our next walkthrough, here we show how to parallelize
estimation with a single learner. Using the integrated :mod:`joblib` package, we can fit a
learner in parallel as follow:



.. code-block:: python

    from mlens.externals.joblib import Parallel, delayed
    from numpy.testing import assert_array_equal

    P_t = np.zeros((y.shape[0], 2))

    # Since ML-Ensemble is thread-safe, we use threading as P_t is not memmapped.
    with Parallel(backend='threading', n_jobs=-1) as parallel:
        parallel(delayed(sublearner, check_pickle=False)(path.name)
                 for sublearner in learner.gen_fit(X, y, P_t)
                 )

    assert_array_equal(P, P_t)

Joblib is built on top of the :mod:`multiprocessing` package, and we
can similarly directly use the ``Pool().map()`` API to achieve the same
result:



.. code-block:: python


    # The dummy module wraps the threading package in the multiprocessing API
    from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool

    def run(tup): tup[0](tup[1])

    P_p = np.zeros((y.shape[0], 2))
    Pool(4).map(run, [(sublearner, path.name)
                      for sublearner in learner.gen_fit(X, y, P_p)])

    assert_array_equal(P, P_t)

Next we handle several learners by grouping them in a layer in the
:ref:`layer mechanics tutorial <layer_tutorial>`.
