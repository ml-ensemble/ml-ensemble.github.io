# Propagating input features
# --------------------------
#
# When stacking several layers of base learners, the variance of the input
# will typically get smaller as learners get better and better at predicting
# the output and the remaining errors become increasingly difficult to correct
# for. This multicolinearity can significantly limit the ability of the
# ensemble to improve upon the best score of the subsequent layer as there is too
# little variation in predictions for the ensemble to learn useful combinations.
# One way to increase this variation is to propagate features from the original
# input and / or earlier layers. To achieve this in ML-Ensemble, we use the
# ``propagate_features`` attribute. To see how this works, let's compare
# a three-layer ensemble with and without feature propagation.

#
# Probabilistic ensemble learning
# -------------------------------
#
# When the target to predict is a class label, it can often be beneficial to
# let higher-order layers or the meta learner learn from *class probabilities*,
# as opposed to the predicted class. Scikit-learn classifiers can return a
# matrix that, for each observation in the test set, gives the probability that
# the observation belongs to the a given class. While we are ultimately
# interested in class membership, this information is much richer that just
# feeding the predicted class to the meta learner. In essence, using class
# probabilities allow the meta learner to weigh in not just the predicted
# class label (the highest probability), but also with what confidence each
# estimator makes the prediction, and how estimators consider the alternative.
# First, let us set a benchmark ensemble performance when learning is by
# predicted class membership.

# .. _subsemble-tutorial:
#
# Advanced Subsemble techniques
# -----------------------------
#
# .. currentmodule:: mlens.ensemble
#
# Subsembles leverages the idea that neighborhoods of feature space have a
# specific local structure. When we fit an estimator across all feature space,
# it is very hard to capture several such local properties. Subsembles partition
# the feature space and fits each base learner to each partitions, thereby
# allow base learners to optimize locally. Instead, the task of generalizing
# across neighborhoods is left to the meta learner. This strategy can be very
# powerful when the local structure first needs to be extracted, before an
# estimator can learn to generalize. Suppose you want to learn the probability
# distribution of some variable :math:`y`. Often, the true distribution is
# multi-modal, which is an extremely hard problem. In fact, most
# machine learning algorithms, especially with convex optimization objectives, are
# ill equipped to solve this problem. Subsembles can overcome this issue allowing
# base estimators to fit one mode of the distribution at a time, which yields a
# better representation of the distribution and greatly facilitates the learning
# problem of the meta learner.
#
# .. py:currentmodule:: mlens.ensemble
#
# By default, the :class:`Subsemble` class partitioning the dataset randomly.
# Note however that partitions are created on the data "as is", so if the ordering
# of observations is not random, neither will the partitioning be. For this
# reason, it is recommended to shuffle the data (e.g. via the ``shuffle``
# option at initialization). To build a subsemble with random partitions, the
# only parameter needed is the number of ``partitions`` when instantiating
# the :class:`Subsemble`.

from mlens.ensemble import Subsemble

from sklearn.svm import SVC

def build_subsemble():
    """Build a subsemble with random partitions"""
    sub = Subsemble(partitions=3, folds=2)
    sub.add([SVC(), LogisticRegression()])
    return sub

sub= build_subsemble()
sub.fit(X, y)
s = sub.predict(X[:10]).shape[1]
print("No. prediction features: %i " % s)

##############################################################################
# During training, the base learners are copied to each partition,
# so the output of each layer gets multiplied by the number of partitions. In this
# case, we have 2 base learners for 3 partitions, giving 6 prediction features.

##############################################################################
# By creating partitions, subsembles :ref:`scale significantly better <bench>`
# than the
# :class:`SuperLearner`, but in contrast to :class:`BlendEnsemble`,
# the full training data is leveraged during training. But randomly partitioning
# the data does however not exploit the full advantage of locality, since it is
# only by luck that we happen to create such partitions. A better way is to
# *learn* how to best partition the data. We can either use
# unsupervised algorithms to generate clusters, or supervised estimators and
# create partitions based on their predictions. In ML-Ensemble, this is
# achieved by passing an estimator as ``partition_estimator``. This estimator
# can differ between layers.

##############################################################################
# .. currentmodule:: mlens.index
#
# Very few limitation are imposed on the estimator: you can specify whether
# you want to fit it before generating partitions, whether to use
# labels in the partitioning, and what method to call to generate the
# partitions. See :class:`ClusteredSubsetIndex` for the full documentation.
# This level of generality does impose some
# responsibility on the user. In particular, it is up to the user to ensure that
# sensible partitions are created. Problems to watch out for is too small
# partitions (too many clusters, too uneven cluster sizes) and clusters with too
# little variation: for instance with only a single class label in the entire
# partition, base learners have nothing to learn. Let's see how to do this in
# practice. For instance, we can use an unsupervised K-Means
# clustering estimator to partition the data, like so:

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    sub.add_meta(SVC())
    return sub

sub = build_clustered_subsemble(KMeans(2))
sub.fit(X[:, [0, 1]], y)

##############################################################################
# The Iris dataset can actually separate the classes perfectly with a KMeans
# estimator which leads to zero label variation in each partition. For that
# reason the above code fits the KMeans estimator on only the first two
# columns. But this approach is nota very good way of doing it since we loose
# the rest of the data when fitting the estimators too. Instead, we could
# customize the
# partitioning estimator to make the subset selection itself. For instance,
# we can use Scikit-learn's :class:`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`
# class to put a dimensionality reduction transformer before the partitioning
# estimator, such as a :class:`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`, or the
# :class:`mlens.preprocessing.Subset` transformer to drop some features before
# estimation. We then use this pipeline as a our partition estimator and fit
# the subsemble on all features.

from mlens.preprocessing import Subset
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# This partition estimator is equivalent to the one used above
pe = make_pipeline(Subset([0, 1]), KMeans(2))
sub = build_clustered_subsemble(pe)

sub.fit(X, y)

##############################################################################
# In general, you may need to wrap an estimator around a custom class to modify
# it's output to generate good partitions. For instance, in regression problems,
# the output of a supervised estimator needs to be binarized to give a discrete
# number of partitions. Here's minimalist way of wrapping a Scikit-learn
# estimator:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(MyClass, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def fit(self, X, y):

        """Generate partition"""
        p = super(MyClass, self).predict(X)
        return 1 * (p > p.mean())


##############################################################################
# Importantly, your partition estimator should implement a ``get_params``
# method to avoid unexpected errors. If you don't, you may encounter
# a ``NotFittedError`` when calling ``predict``.
# To summarize the functionality in one example,
# let's implement a simple (but rather useless) partition estimator that splits
# the data in half based on the sum of the features.

# A final word of caution. When implementing custom estimators from scratch, some
# care needs to be taken if you plan on copying the Subsemble. It is advised that
# the estimator inherits the :class:`sklearn.base.BaseEstimator` class to

# .. _sequential-tutorial:
#
# General multi-layer ensemble learning
# -------------------------------------
#
# .. currentmodule:: mlens.ensemble
#
# To alternate between the *type* of layer with each ``add`` call,
# the :class:`SequentialEnsemble` class can be used to specify what type of
# layer (i.e. stacked, blended, subsamle-style) to add. This is particularly
# powerful if facing a large dataset, as the first layer can use a fast approach
# such as blending, while subsequent layers fitted on the remaining data can
# use more computationally intensive approaches.

from mlens.ensemble import SequentialEnsemble

ensemble = SequentialEnsemble()

# The initial layer is a blended layer, same as a layer in the BlendEnsemble
ensemble.add('blend',
             [SVC(), RandomForestClassifier(random_state=seed)])

# The second layer is a stacked layer, same as a layer of the SuperLearner
ensemble.add('stack', [SVC(), RandomForestClassifier(random_state=seed)])

# The third layer is a subsembled layer, same as a layer of the Subsemble
ensemble.add('subsemble', [SVC(), RandomForestClassifier(random_state=seed)])

# The meta estimator is added as in any other ensemble
ensemble.add_meta(SVC())

##############################################################################
# The below table maps the types of layers available in the :class:`SequentialEnsemble` with the corresponding ensemble.
#
# ===================  ============================
# Ensemble equivalent  SequentialEnsemble parameter
# ===================  ============================
# 'SuperLearner'       'stack'
# 'BlendEnsemble'      'blend'
# 'Subsemble'          'subsemble'
# ===================  ============================
#
# Once instantiated, the :class:`SequentialEnsemble`` behaves as expect:
preds = ensemble.fit(X[:75], y[:75]).predict(X[75:])
accuracy_score(preds, y[75:])

##############################################################################
# In this case, the multi-layer :class:`SequentialEnsemble` with an initial
# blended layer and second stacked layer achieves similar performance as the
# :class:`BlendEnsemble` with probabilistic learning. Note that we could have
# made any of the layers probabilistic by setting ``Proba=True``.
#
# .. _memory-tutorial:
#
# Passing file paths as data input
# --------------------------------
#
# With large datasets, it can be expensive to load the full data into memory as
# a numpy array. Since ML-Ensemle uses a memmaped cache, the need to keep the
# full array in memory can be entirely circumvented by passing a file path as
# entry to ``X`` and ``y``. There are two important things to note when doing
# this.

##############################################################################
# First, ML-Ensemble delpoys Scikit-learn's array checks, and passing a
# string will cause an error. To avoid this, the ensemble must be initialized
# with ``array_check=0``, in which case there will be no checks on the array.
# The user should make certain that the the data is approprate for esitmation,
# by converting missing values and infinites to numerical representation,
# ensuring that all features are numerical, and remove any headers,
# index columns and footers.
#
# Second, ML-Ensemble expects the file to be either a ``csv``,
# an ``npy`` or ``mmap`` file and will treat these differently.
#
#     - If a path to a ``csv`` file is passed, the ensemble will first **load**
#       the file into memory, then dump it into the cache, before discarding the
#       file from memory by replacing it with a pointer to the memmaped file.
#       The loading module used for the ``csv``
#       file is the :func:`numpy.loadtxt` function.
#
#     - If a path to a ``npy`` file is passed, a memmaped pointer to it will be
#       loaded.
#
#     - If a path to a ``mmap`` file is passed, it will be used as the memmaped
#       input array for estimation.
#

# We create a temporary folder in the current working directory

# Dump the X and y array in the temporary directory, here as csv files

# .. _model-selection-tutorial:
#
# Ensemble model selection
# ------------------------
#
# Ensembles benefit from a diversity of base learners, but often it is not clear
# how to parametrize the base learners. In fact, combining base learners with
# lower predictive power can often yield a superior ensemble. This hinges on the
# errors made by the base learners being relatively uncorrelated, thus allowing
# a meta estimator to learn how to overcome each model's weakness. But with
# highly correlated errors, there is little for the ensemble to learn from.

##############################################################################
# To fully exploit the learning capacity in an ensemble, it is beneficial to
# conduct careful hyper parameter tuning, treating the base learner's parameters
# as the parameters of the ensemble. By far the most critical part of the
# ensemble is the meta learner, but selecting an appropriate meta learner can be
# an ardous task if the entire ensemble has to be evaluated each time.
#
# .. py:currentmodule:: mlens.preprocessing
#

##############################################################################
# The task can be made considerably easier by treating the lower layers of an
# ensemble as preprocessing pipeline, and performing model selection on
# higher-order layers or meta learners. To use an ensemble for this purpose,
# set the ``model_selection`` parameter to ``True`` before fitting. This will
# modify how the ``transform`` method behaves, to ensure ``predict`` is called
# on test folds.
