        "\n\n\n\n.. currentmodule: mlens.parallel.learner\n\nSequential Mechanics\n====================\n\nML-Ensemble is designed to provide an easy user interface. But it is also designed\nto be extremely flexible, all the wile providing maximum concurrency at minimal\nmemory consumption. The lower-level API that builds the ensemble and manages the\ncomputations is constructed in as modular a fashion as possible.\n\nThe low-level API introduces a computational graph-like environment that you can\ndirectly exploit to gain further control over your ensemble. In fact, building\nyour ensemble through the low-level API is almost as straight forward as using the\nhigh-level API. In this tutorial, we will walk through the key core :class:`Learner` class.\n\n\n\n"
