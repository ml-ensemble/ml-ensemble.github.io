        "\n\n\n\n.. currentmodule: mlens.parallel\n\nParallel Mechanics\n==================\n\nML-Ensemble is designed to provide an easy user interface. But it is also designed\nto be extremely flexible, all the wile providing maximum concurrency at minimal\nmemory consumption. The lower-level API that builds the ensemble and manages the\ncomputations is constructed in as modular a fashion as possible.\n\nThe low-level API introduces a computational graph-like environment that you can\ndirectly exploit to gain further control over your ensemble. In fact, building\nyour ensemble through the low-level API is almost as straight forward as using the\nhigh-level API. In this tutorial, we will walk through the core\n:class:`ParallelProcessing` class.\n\nThe purpose of the :class:`ParallelProcessing` class is to provide a streamlined\ninterface for scheduling and allocating jobs in a nested sequence of tasks. The\ntypical case is a sequence of :class:`Layer` instances where the output of one layer\nbecomes the input to the next. While the layers must therefore be fitted sequentially,\neach layer should be fitted in parallel. We might be interested in propagating some of the\nfeatures from one layer to the next, in which case we need to take care of the array allocation.\n\nParallelProcessing API\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBasic map\n\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8\n\nIn the simplest case, we have a ``caller` that has a set of ``task``s that needs to be\nevaluated in parallel. For instance, the ``caller`` might be a :class:`Learner`, with\neach task being a fit job for a given cross-validation fold. In this simple case,\nwe want to perform an embarrassingly parallel for-loop of each fold, which we can\nachieve with the ``map`` method of the :class:`ParallelProcessing` class.\n\n"
